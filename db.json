It is rare in our city, given that most soils are primarily calcareous.\n\nIn Monterols Park, the availability of space and the lack of competition with other species, which would be typical if it lived in the forest, have allowed it to develop its canopy freely and acquire an aesthetic and harmonious appearance. It is the most notable cork oak specimen in urban public spaces.",

    "text": "An international study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) confirms that living near greenery significantly reduces the risk of premature death.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from over 8 million people in seven countries, using satellite images to measure vegetation near their homes. The finding is clear: for every 0.1 increase in the NDVI vegetation index within 500 meters of a residence, there's a 4% reduction in mortality risk.\n\nThis supports what we already sensed‚Äîgreen spaces don‚Äôt just lift our mood and reduce stress; they also help save lives.\n\nISGlobal researchers urge that expanding urban green spaces should be a public health and urban planning priority. Beyond health, these areas boost biodiversity, fight climate change, and make cities more livable and sustainable.",
