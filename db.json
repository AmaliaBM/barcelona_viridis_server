    "title": "More Green, Less Premature Death",
    "text": "An international study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) confirms that living near greenery significantly reduces the risk of premature death.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from over 8 million people in seven countries, using satellite images to measure vegetation near their homes. The finding is clear: for every 0.1 increase in the NDVI vegetation index within 500 meters of a residence, there's a 4% reduction in mortality risk.\n\nThis supports what we already sensed‚Äîgreen spaces don‚Äôt just lift our mood and reduce stress; they also help save lives.\n\nISGlobal researchers urge that expanding urban green spaces should be a public health and urban planning priority. Beyond health, these areas boost biodiversity, fight climate change, and make cities more livable and sustainable.",
